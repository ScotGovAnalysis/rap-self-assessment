<!-- Code well-commented -->

Code comments should be used to provide context to your code. Commenting your code will help others understand the code you've written and why it's been written in a particular way.

A commented line of R code starts with a single `#` followed by a space. 

[Further guidance on writing code comments is available in the Duck book](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/code_documentation.html#comments).
