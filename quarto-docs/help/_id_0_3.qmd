<!-- Repository self-contained and well-structured -->

A repository is another word for the folder where all the files for your project are stored. A self-contained repository means all files required for the project are stored in the same place.

Your repository should have a sensible, organised, clear structure. Sub-folders may be created for code, data, lookups, data, outputs, functions (pick and choose which are relevant to your project).

Code scripts should be numbered if they should be run in a certain order. Data and output files should be date-stamped. 

It should be clear to somebody new to the project where to look for certain files. 

The following guidance is available to help you with this:
