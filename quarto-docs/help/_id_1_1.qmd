<!-- Code follows a style guide -->

A style guide describes best practices for writing clean, consistent and maintainable code. For example:

-   Naming conventions for variables, functions, files.
-   Formatting rules to make your code easier to read.
-   Standard ways document and comment code.
-   Best practices for writing efficient code, reducing errors.

For R we recommend following the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).

Applying these conventions will make your code look more professional and will mean it is more easily understood by others.
