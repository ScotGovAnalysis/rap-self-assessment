<!-- Code used for all data processing steps -->

Data processing includes steps to extract data from its storage location, cleaning, restructuring and linking with other data sources.

Using code for these steps can help to document all changes that are made to a dataset and minimise the risk of human error when carrying out these steps manually.

The R for Data Science book has guidance on using code for [importing data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-import), [data transformation](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform) and [tidying](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy), including recommendations of which R packages to use.
