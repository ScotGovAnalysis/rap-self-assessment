<!--Code reviewed externally (by somebody outside of immediate team)-->
Having someone external to the team without internal knowledge of the data and processes can provide benefits such as:

- Ensures reproducibility of the process as a standalone process without relying on undocumented internal knowledge.
- People distant from the process can provide useful feedback and perspective on a process.

See Duck Book section on [peer review](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/peer_review.html).

It might not always be possible to get someone cleared to access the data required to run the full process. If that is the case a knowledgeable reviewer on RAP best practices might still offer suggestions on style and structure of the code.
