<!-- Using configurable parameters -->

A data analysis process is more secure and reusable if certain values are stored separately from the analysis code. For example:

*	Directory paths for reading or writing files such as csv files or spreadsheets

*	Database connection details

*	A URL and API key required to access an external API to read data

*	Parameter values to be set before running the code, for example a reference year

Writing such values directly into code is known as hard-coding and it is best avoided where possible. It is better practice to manage these type of variables as [configurable parameters](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/configuration.html).

For sensitive variables such as API keys consider using the keyring package for R or Python to store these securely. An alternative is to create an environment variable.

For less sensitive parameters a config file or script can be used to set values such as file paths or analytical variables used throughout a process. 

More information is available in the [Configuration chapter of the Duck Book](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/configuration.html). More detailed internal guidance will be made available soon.
