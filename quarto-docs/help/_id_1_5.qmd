<!-- Using Git -->

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control software for tracking changes to files. Using Git means you donâ€™t need to save multiple copies of the same file to retain older versions. Git keeps a record of what change was made, when the change was made, why the change was made, and who made the change.

Guidance for installing and using Git on the SCOTS network is available on the [Statistics Group SharePoint site](https://scotsconnect.sharepoint.com/sites/StatisticsGroup-Org-SG/SitePages/Version-Control.aspx).
