<!-- Code reviewed by somebody inside the immediate team -->

Having your code reviewed by somebody else in your team can assure you that:

-   your code works as expected
-   your analysis is reproducible
-   your documentation provides sufficient information for somebody else to know how to run your code

The criteria in this [RAP self-assessment tool](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/sg-rap-self-assessment/) can be used as a check-list for code review.

Code review can be a one-off exercise but ideally somebody else should review your code any time a change is made. If you are already using GitHub, this can be facilitated by using [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
