<!--Outputs produced by code-->
A RAP project usually produces one or more outputs such as a report in html format or a dashboard. These outputs might be published externally.  

Open source programming languages such as R allow all components of an output to be created with code. This includes all charts, tables and commentary they contain. R Markdown or Quarto might be used for html reports or Shiny for dashboards.

Some benefits of this approach:
-  It reduces error in copying and pasting items into a document.
-  It saves time once the report is coded as it can be regenerated each time source data is updated.
-  It can ensure accessible, well formatted and professional looking outputs.
