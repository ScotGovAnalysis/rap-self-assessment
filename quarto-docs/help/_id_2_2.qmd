<!--Data quality assurance built into code-->

Code can be used to automate data quality assurance. Checking assumptions about data early in your analysis pipeline ensures that any issues can be spotted and dealt with quickly.

The simplest way to do this is to write some code that will generate an error or warning if something unexpected occurs. For example, if you expect at least 100 rows of data:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
if(nrow(data) < 100) {
  stop("There are fewer than 100 rows of data.")
}
```

For more sophisticated data quality assurance, try using either the [assertr](https://docs.ropensci.org/assertr/) or [validate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/validate/vignettes/cookbook.html) packages.
