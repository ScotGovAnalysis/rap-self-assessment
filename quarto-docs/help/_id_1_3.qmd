<!--Outputs produced by code-->

Open source programming languages such as R allow all components of a published output to be created with code. This includes all charts, tables and commentary. [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/docs/) or [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html) might be used for html reports or [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) for dashboards.

Some benefits of this approach:

-   It reduces error in copying and pasting items into a document.
-   It saves time regenerating the report for updated source data as the process has been automated.
-   It can ensure accessible, well formatted and professional looking outputs.
