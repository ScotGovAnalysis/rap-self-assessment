<!--Re-usable components are packaged-->
Creating an installable package is the best way to make code components available for use in other projects within your team, or even the wider organisation.

An example of a package developed in the Scottish Government and used by many teams is [sgplot](https://scotgovanalysis.github.io/sgplot/).

R and Python both have specific structures for packaging code. If you are new to creating packages in R then the [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) online book is an excellent place to start. It is surprisingly easy to create an installable package in R!

In Python you can build a package installable with `pip` and publish it on PyPI. [This tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/) in the Python Packaging User Guide is a good place to start.
