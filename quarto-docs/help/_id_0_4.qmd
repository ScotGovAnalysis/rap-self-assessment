<!-- Repository includes a README file -->

A README file should be stored within your repository and contain a brief overview of the project including instructions for running the code and contact details for the team who owns the project.

The README can be in any text file format, however if you are using or plan to use GitHub, it is recommended to use a markdown file format (`.md`) as this will be automatically displayed in your GitHub repository.

[Further guidance on README files is available in the Duck book](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/project_documentation.html#readme).
