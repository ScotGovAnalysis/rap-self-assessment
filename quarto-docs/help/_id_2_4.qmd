<!--Dependencies documented-->

To ensure reproducibility of your code it is important that package dependencies are documented in your RAP project code repository. Record names and (ideally) the version of each external R or Python package used.

This [Government Analysis Function article](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/dependency-and-reproducibility/) has some useful information.

Ways to achieve this for RAP projects primarily coded in R:

-   Consider having one R script where all the packages used in the project are loaded. Document this in the README.
-   The output of `devtools::session_info()$packages` could be saved to a text file in your repository.
-   If developing an R package, the DESCRIPTION file provides a formal way to record package dependencies.

Level 3 - "Advanced RAP Computational environment documented" is a further step to ensure specification of the computing environment has been documented.
