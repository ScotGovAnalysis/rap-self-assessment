<!-- Code written in an open-source language; e.g. R -->

One of the basic principles of RAP is to use open-source software instead of proprietary software. In the Scottish Government, R is the most widely used and supported open-source software.

Information on [how to install R, RStudio and R packages within SCOTS](https://erdm.scotland.gov.uk:8443/documents/A42404229/details) is available on eRDM.

Further support and guidance can be sought in the [R Users community on Viva Engage](https://web.yammer.com/main/groups/eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiI2MzQ4MzE2NjczIn0).
