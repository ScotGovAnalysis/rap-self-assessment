<!-- Code published publicly on GitHub -->

Making your code open means it is available to anybody who would like to view it. Publishing your code can:

-   Increase trust in your analysis
-   Encourage collaboration
-   Improve quality
-   Help others benefit from your work.

The [Duck Book](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/project_documentation.html#open-source-your-code) provides more examples of how publishing your code can bring personal benefits and benefits to the public.

In the Scottish Government, analysts can publish their code on the [Scottish Government Analysis GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ScotGovAnalysis). GitHub is a web interface for hosting version controlled code. GitHub can also be used to facilitate code reviews, manage projects and track issues.

It is very important that sensitive information isn't published alongside code. This can be achieved by including a [gitignore file](https://github.com/ScotGovAnalysis/welcome/blob/main/.gitignore) in your repository that lists directories, file extensions and specific files that shouldn't be tracked by Git. 

It is also important to ensure that your code doesn't contain any sensitive hard-coded information. [Using configurable parameters](#using-configurable-parameters) helps to avoid this.

There may also be cases where the project as a whole is too sensitive to be published (e.g. if the project concerns a topic not suitable for the public domain). In these cases, this criteria can be marked as 'Complete'. Consider adding a note that explains why you made this decision for future reference.

Guidance for using GitHub on the SCOTS network is available on the [Statistics Group SharePoint site](https://scotsconnect.sharepoint.com/sites/StatisticsGroup-Org-SG/SitePages/Version-Control.aspx), including [user responsibilities](https://erdm.scotland.gov.uk/documents/A42743383/details).
