A further step in ensuring reproducibility of a RAP process is to document the version of R or Python and the operating system on which the RAP has been developed.

A basic way to achieve this in R could be to save the output of `devtools::session_info()` into the repository. 

A more advanced solution is to use a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container and publish a Dockerfile in your code repository. 

Use of Docker is quite an advanced topic, but helpful resources exist for both R and Python. For R see [this chapter](https://raps-with-r.dev/repro_cont.html#what-is-docker) of the RAPs with R online book and look at the [Rocker project](https://rocker-project.org/). 

For Python, start by documenting the packages used in your code in an environment.yml or requirements.txt file in your repository. This file is then the basis for your Dockerfile. For Python you might find [this introductory guide](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/wrkflow-rap.html#reproducible-computational-environments) useful.
